# Dog-Breed-Classifier

This project aims at identifying an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.This project is a part of Udacity's Nanodegree program.

# Description

A Convolutional Neural Network was built from scratch using PyTorch. 

# Results

The goal of the project was to meet the following specifications:
* Assess the Human Face Detector
* Use a pre-trained VGG16 Net to find the predicted class for a given image. Use this to complete a dog_detector function below that returns True if a dog is detected in an image (and False if not).
* Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Create a CNN Using Transfer Learning
